# modkit

modkit is a Go-idiomatic backend service framework with a NestJS-inspired module architecture (imports/providers/controllers/exports). The MVP focuses on deterministic bootstrapping, explicit dependency resolution, and a thin HTTP adapter.

## Status

This repository is in early MVP implementation. APIs and structure may change before v0.1.0.

## Quickstart (stub)

```bash
go get github.com/aryeko/modkit
```

Documentation and examples will be added during implementation.
